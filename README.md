# Advent of Code 2021 in Rust
My [AoC 2021][aoc-2021] solutions in the Rust programming language.
This repository contains (/will contain) every AoC day solved as a separate Rust project.



| Day               | Completion                      |
| :---------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| [I][aoc-2021-1]   | [Completed](./day1/src/lib.rs)  |
| [II][aoc-2021-2]  | [Completed](./day2/src/lib.rs)  |
| [III][aoc-2021-3] | [Completed](./day3/src/lib.rs)  |
| [IV][aoc-2021-4]  | [Completed](./day4/src/lib.rs)  |
| [V][aoc-2021-5]   | [Completed](./day5/src/lib.rs)  |

It takes the `input` as a `file.txt` and it prints the result to `stdout`.

I've included comments and tests for each solution.
